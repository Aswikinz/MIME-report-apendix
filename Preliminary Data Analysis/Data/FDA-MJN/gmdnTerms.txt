00836462006010|Catheter/overtube balloon inflator, single-use|A device designed to inflate and regulate the pressure of the balloon of a catheter, endoscopic overtube, or other invasive device (e.g., tamp, endomicroscopy probe), typically by injecting and aspirating fluid or air within the balloon, and to deflate the balloon during a medical procedure. It typically consists of a dedicated manual syringe/plunger or electronic mechanism for inflation/deflation, an analogue or digital gauge/screen for monitoring pressure, a locking mechanism, and a connecting tube.
